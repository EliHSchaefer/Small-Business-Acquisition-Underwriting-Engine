**Small-Business-Acquisition-Underwriting-Engine**

This repository contains a comprehensive underwriting engine designed to evaluate small business acquisition opportunities with institutional rigor.

The engine integrates:

• Customer concentration analysis
• Revenue quality assessment
• EBITDA normalization and add-back transparency
• SBA debt structuring and DSCR stress testing
• 5-year projections with downside scenarios
• IRR and exit multiple modeling

The objective of this project is to replicate the full acquisition underwriting process — from raw financials to capital structure to exit valuation — in a structured, repeatable framework.

This system is designed to support disciplined capital allocation in lower-middle-market and small business transactions.

**SBA-Debt-Service-Coverage-Model**

This project develops a structured SBA underwriting model focused on debt service coverage, capital structure durability, and lender-facing analysis.

The model is implemented in two formats:

• A clean, lender-ready Excel underwriting template
• A Python (OpenPyXL) automation layer for scenario iteration and comparative analysis

Core outputs include:

• Annual and minimum DSCR
• Debt amortization schedule
• Cash flow after debt service
• Sensitivity analysis under EBITDA contraction scenarios
• Comparative evaluation across different equity and rate structures

The objective of this model is to stress-test acquisition structures and evaluate debt sustainability under realistic operating volatility.

**Revenue-Quality-and-Concentration-Analyzer**

This project analyzes revenue durability and customer dependency within small businesses using structured SQL-based financial analysis.

The framework evaluates:

• Customer concentration metrics (Top 1, 3, 5 revenue share)
• Revenue volatility and trend stability
• Repeat customer behavior and recurrence patterns
• Cohort-based retention analysis

The model emphasizes data extraction, cleaning, and structured evaluation to assess the quality and sustainability of revenue streams.

This tool reinforces acquisition risk discipline by identifying fragility hidden within reported revenue figures.


**EBITDA-Normalization-and-Financial-Adjustments**
This project builds a structured EBITDA normalization engine for small business acquisitions. 
The model adjusts reported financials to reflect true operating performance by identifying owner add-backs, non-recurring expenses, discretionary spending, and market-based compensation adjustments.

The engine outputs:

• Reported vs. Adjusted EBITDA
• Add-back categorization and transparency
• Sensitivity analysis under conservative, base, and aggressive cases
• Impact on valuation at different exit multiples



**Acquisition-Risk-Scoring-Framework**

This project develops a structured risk scoring framework for evaluating small business acquisition targets. The model quantifies business fragility and underwriting risk using measurable operational and financial metrics.

Risk components include:

• Customer concentration
• Revenue volatility
• Margin stability
• Leverage exposure
• Industry cyclicality

Each factor is weighted to produce a composite acquisition risk score, enabling probabilistic decision-making rather than intuition-based underwriting.

The goal of this framework is to introduce institutional-style risk discipline into small business acquisition analysis.



**Private-Equity-Small-Business-Case-Study**

This project presents a fully structured small-business acquisition case study modeled in a private equity underwriting format. The objective is to demonstrate end-to-end deal evaluation — from financial review to capital structure to exit modeling — in a clear, narrative-driven format.

The case study includes:

• Business overview and industry context
• Revenue quality and customer concentration analysis
• EBITDA normalization and adjustment rationale
• SBA debt structuring and DSCR stress testing
• 5-year projection with operational improvement assumptions
• Exit valuation under multiple scenarios
• IRR and equity multiple analysis

The final deliverable is a polished PDF investment memo designed to simulate institutional underwriting documentation for small business acquisitions.

This project emphasizes structured thinking, capital allocation discipline, and professional presentation.

**Industry-Comparable-Valuation-Database**

This project builds a structured valuation database of small and lower-middle-market businesses to support multiple-based acquisition analysis. The objective is to quantify how growth, margin profile, and risk characteristics influence transaction multiples.

The database includes:

• Revenue and EBITDA ranges
• Industry classification
• Growth rates
• Margin profiles
• Observed or modeled transaction multiples

Analytical outputs include:

• Comparable company screening by industry and size
• Regression analysis linking growth and margin to valuation multiple
• Sensitivity modeling for multiple compression or expansion
• Implied valuation ranges under varying performance scenarios

This tool reinforces valuation discipline and supports data-driven pricing decisions in small business acquisitions.

**Working-Capital-and-Cash-Conversion-Analyzer**

This project analyzes working capital efficiency and cash flow durability within small businesses. The objective is to evaluate how quickly earnings convert to usable cash and to identify hidden liquidity risks.

The model evaluates:

• Accounts receivable aging and collection cycles
• Accounts payable timing and vendor dependency
• Inventory turnover and capital intensity
• Cash conversion cycle duration
• Working capital as a percentage of revenue

Outputs include:

• Required working capital at acquisition
• Liquidity stress testing under revenue contraction
• Impact of working capital changes on DSCR
• Cash efficiency benchmarking across industries

This framework introduces institutional working capital analysis into small business underwriting — an area often overlooked in lower-market acquisitions.
